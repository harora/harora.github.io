As 2024 comes to a close, a thought experiment from 1871 keeps coming back to me: "The Centipede's Dilemma: Ask a centipede which one of its hundred legs moves the fastest, and it forgets how to move. Reflecting on what we normally do without thought ironically worsens performance."

This quirky little thought experiment highlights a fascinating truth about our world today. With so much emphasis on self-reflection and optimization, sometimes I feel we're losing our ability to just *do* things and face the world using the instincts and experience we've gained through evolution. It's like that old saying, "analyze the game, and you lose it." 

The original poem, by Katherine Craster, paints a vivid picture:

> The Centipede was happy – quite!
>
> Until a toad in fun
>
> Said, "Pray, which leg goes after which?"
>
> This wrought her soul to such a pitch,
>
> She lay distracted in a ditch
>
> Considering how to run.

Just like the centipede, when we get bogged down in the minutiae of our actions, we can lose the natural flow and spontaneity that allows us to excel. This isn't to say that self-reflection is *bad* – introspection and therapy can be incredibly valuable tools. However, there's a balance to be struck. 

This is further amplified by modern-day reels and social media, where every aspect of life has to be visually captured and discussed. Often, when I see certain posts, I think, "Wasn't this obvious? Was there a need to post this?" For example 'How to spend time on a long flight', where the poster shares very obvious things that most people already do.  Are we overthinking even the simplest experiences?

In our modern world, with its constant emphasis on self-analysis and optimization, it's easy to fall into the trap of the centipede. We can become so preoccupied with dissecting our every move that we lose sight of the simple joy of movement itself.  Perhaps it's time to step back, trust our instincts, and rediscover the freedom of acting without overthinking.
