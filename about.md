My name is Rif. I work at Google on probabilistic machine learning and auditory machine learing. In my spare time I enjoy meditating, cooking, computer programming, math, dancing, playing music, philosophy, lifting weights, economics, and indoor bouldering.

You can see (and probably retrieve most of) my publications from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QNnjg7YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

In a past life, I published under [a different name](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qbjHRA8AAAAJ&hl=en).
